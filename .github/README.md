# GitHub Configuration & AI Resources

This directory contains AI agents, prompts, and configuration that power the **AI-Assisted Testing Infrastructure** for this Cypress/Playwright repository.

## 🤖 AI Orchestrator

The **QA Orchestrator** (`@qa-orchestrator`) is the central AI controller that analyzes your testing needs, infers unstated requirements, and delegates work to specialized personas.

### Key Features

- 🧠 **Requirement Inference**: Automatically identifies accessibility, security, and performance needs
- 🎯 **Smart Delegation**: Routes tasks to the right QA persona
- 💰 **Cost-Optimized**: Uses premium models (1X) for strategy, low-cost models (0X) for execution
- 📊 **Requirement Traceability**: Links tests to requirements and acceptance criteria

### How to Use

**Invoke the Orchestrator**:

```
@qa-orchestrator create comprehensive tests for the login feature
@qa-orchestrator fix the failing checkout test
@qa-orchestrator migrate cypress tests to playwright
```

The orchestrator will:

1. Analyze your request (stated + unstated requirements)
2. Select appropriate personas (QA Engineer, SDET, etc.)
3. Coordinate the work
4. Ensure quality standards are met

## 🎭 QA Personas

All personas use **low-cost models (0X tier)** for efficient execution:

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide for Beginners

### Step 1: Understanding the System

This repository uses AI agents to help you with testing. Think of it as having a team of QA experts available 24/7:

- **Orchestrator**: The team lead who assigns work
- **Personas**: Specialists (engineer, architect, tester, etc.)

### Step 2: Using in VS Code

1. **Open GitHub Copilot Chat** (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Shift+I on Mac)
2. **Invoke the Orchestrator**:
   ```
   @qa-orchestrator I need tests for the login page
   ```
3. **Or Use Slash Commands**:
   ```
   /playwright-create login functionality
   ```

### Step 3: What the AI Will Do

The AI will:

1. **Ask clarifying questions** (if needed)
2. **Analyze requirements** (stated + unstated)
3. **Generate tests** with:
   - Functional tests (happy path + errors)
   - Accessibility tests (keyboard nav, ARIA)
   - Security tests (XSS prevention, validation)
   - Performance tests (load times)

### Step 4: Review the Output

The AI will create:

- Test files (`*.spec.ts` or `*.cy.ts`)
- Page Objects (`*Page.ts`)
- Fixtures (if needed)

**Always review the generated code** before committing!

### Step 5: Run the Tests

```bash
# Playwright
npx playwright test

# Cypress
npm run cy:run
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Agent not found"

Make sure you're using the correct agent name with `@` prefix:

```
@qa-orchestrator (not qa-orchestrator)
@cypress-healer (not cypress healer)
```

### "Slash command not recognized"

Slash commands only work in GitHub Copilot Chat (VS Code). Make sure Copilot is enabled.

### "Tests still failing after healing"

1. Check the error logs carefully
2. Share the trace file or screenshot with the healer
3. Invoke: `/playwright-heal [test] --verbose` for detailed analysis

### "How do I know which agent to use?"

Use `@qa-orchestrator` and let it decide! It will analyze your request and delegate to the right persona.

## 🧠 Memory & Automated Workflows

👉 **Dual Support**: All workflows available for both **GitHub Actions** and **Azure DevOps Pipelines**

- GitHub: `.github/workflows/`
- Azure: `.azure-pipelines/` ([Setup Guide](.../.azure-pipelines/README.md))

### Session Logging

All AI interactions can be tracked in [`.github/memory/session-log.md`](./memory/session-log.md):

- **What**: Logs agent usage, decisions made, files modified
- **When**: Automatically on test file changes (via `ai-session-logger.yml`)
- **Why**: Provides continuity across sessions and requirement traceability

**Manual Logging**: Add entries using the template in `session-log.md`

### Automated Workflows

#### 1. **AI Session Logger** ([`ai-session-logger.yml`](./workflows/ai-session-logger.yml))

- **Triggers**: When test files (`.spec.ts`, `.cy.ts`) are modified
- **Action**: Logs agent used, files changed, commit message to `session-log.md`
- **Usage**: Commit with agent mention: `git commit -m "@playwright-healer fixed checkout test"`

#### 2. **Auto-Heal Failing Tests** ([`auto-heal-tests.yml`](./workflows/auto-heal-tests.yml))

- **Triggers**: When CI fails or manual dispatch
- **Action**: Creates GitHub issue with:
  - Failed test file names
  - Recommended healer agent to use
  - Links to trace files/screenshots
  - Copy-paste commands for Copilot Chat
- **Usage**: Issue provides instructions like:
  ```
  @playwright-healer analyze trace at test-output/playwright-output/trace.zip
  ```

#### 3. **Requirement Tracer** ([`requirement-tracer.yml`](./workflows/requirement-tracer.yml))

- **Triggers**: When test files are modified
- **Action**: Extracts `@feature`, `@acceptance-criteria` from test comments
- **Output**: Generates `traceability-matrix.md` linking requirements → tests
- **PR Comments**: Posts coverage report on pull requests

### How They Work Together

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Developer writes test with AI] --> B[Commit with agent mention]
    B --> C[Session Logger records]
    C --> D[Test runs in CI]
    D -->|Pass| E[Requirement Tracer updates matrix]
    D -->|Fail| F[Auto-Heal creates issue]
    F --> G[Developer uses healer agent]
    G --> B
```

### Example Workflow

1. **Generate Test**: `@qa-orchestrator create tests for checkout`
2. **Commit**: `git commit -m "@automation-engineer added checkout tests"`
3. **Session Logged**: Workflow records agent usage in `session-log.md`
4. **CI Runs**: Test executes
5. **If Fails**: Auto-heal workflow creates issue with healing instructions
6. **Requirement Traced**: Traceability matrix updated with test coverage

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Start with the Orchestrator**: Use `@qa-orchestrator` for complex tasks
2. **Use Slash Commands**: For quick, specific actions (`/playwright-create`)
3. **Review Generated Code**: Always read and understand before committing
4. **Link to Requirements**: Use the traceability template
5. **Follow Templates**: Use BDD or AAA structure consistently
